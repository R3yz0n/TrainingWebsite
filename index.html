        <p>
          Organic agriculture, which is governed by strict government standards,
          requires that products bearing the organic label are produced without
          the use of toxic and persistent pesticides and synthetic nitrogen
          fertilizers, antibiotics, synthetic hormones, genetic engineering or
          other excluded practices, sewage sludge, or irradiation.

          The idea that happier farm animals produce higher quality food is not
          new, and it seems to be catching on. Several small scale egg farmers
          have transitioned to a “pastured” system, allowing their chickens to
          roam freely to eat grass and bugs the way nature intended. These
          chickens are not simply “free range” or “cage free,” which are terms
          that unfortunately don’t have much meaning in today’s food market

        <h1>Of Organic Food</h1>
        <p>
          Organic principles and regulations are also designed to ensure that
          animals are treated humanely, or, to be brutally honest, as humanely
          as possible. There are strict rules on the way in which animals are
          housed, guaranteeing a degree of comfort for the animals. But when it
          comes to vegetables, the situation is quite different.
